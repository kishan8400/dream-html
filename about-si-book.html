                            content conversion to electronic interactive activities,where the student is the doer and

                            the student in his self-learning within groups, using interactive modern technologies"</p>

                        <h2>Concept of E Learning</h2>
                        <p>E-learning refers to the use of electronic media and information and communication
                            technologies in education. E-learning is broadly inclusive of all forms of educational
                            technology in learning and teaching.
                            E-learning includes numerous types of media that deliver text, audio, images, animation, and
                            streaming video, and includes technology applications and processes such as audio or video
                            tape, satellite TV, CD-ROM, and computer-based learning, as well as local intranet/extranet
                            and web-based learning
                            E-learning is a broadly inclusive terminology that describes educational technology that
                            electronically or technologically supports learning and teaching. This broad interpretation
                            focuses on new applications and developments, and also brings learning and media psychology
                            into consideration
                            E-learning can improve interactions between students and instructors, and provide students
                            with tools with which they can independently solve problems. On the other hand, e-learning
                            can deter people from actually learning, as there are many potential distractions.
                            E-learning may facilitate cheating. It might give tech-savvy students an advantage over
                            non-technical students. Approaches to e-learning require a focus on students providing them
                            with tools to support their shared activities and problem based activities.
                            E-learning refers to technology use in learning and education. There are several aspects to
                            describing the intellectual and technical development of e-learning, which can be
                            categorized into discrete areas.</p>
                        <p>These are addressed as following points:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1) E-learning as an educational approach or tool that supports traditional subjects</li>
                            <li>2) E-learning as a technological medium that assists in the communication of knowledge,
                                and its development and exchange</li>
                            <li>3) E-learning itself as an educational subject; such courses may be called "Computer
                                Studies" or "Information and Communication Technology (ICT)"</li>
                            <li>4) E-learning administrative tools such as education management information systems.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The extent to which e-learning assists or replaces other learning and teaching approaches is
                            variable, ranging on a continuum from none to fully online distance learning. A variety of
                            descriptive terms have been employed to categorize the extent to which technology is used.
                            For example, 'hybrid learning' or 'blended learning' may refer to classroom aids and
                            laptops, or may refer to approaches in which traditional classroom time is reduced but not
                            eliminated, and is replaced with some online learning 'Distributed learning' may describe
                            either the e-learning component of a hybrid approach, or fully online distance learning
                            environments.</p>

                        <h2> Concept of E Books</h2>

                        <p>An electronic book is a book-length publication in digital form, consisting of text, images,
                            or both, and produced on, published through, and readable on computers or other electronic
                            devices. Sometimes the equivalent of a conventional printed book, e-books can also be born
                            digital. The Oxford Dictionary of English defines the e-book as "an electronic version of a
                            printed book, but e-books can and do exist without any printed equivalent. Commercially
                            produced and sold E-books are usually intended to be read on dedicated e-book readers.
                            However, almost any sophisticated electronic device that features a controllable viewing
                            screen, including computers, many mobile phones, and nearly all smart phones can also be
                            used to read e-books. </p>
                        <p>As e-book formats emerged and proliferated, some garnered support from major software
                            companies such as Adobe with its PDF format, and others supported by independent and
                            open-source programmers. Different readers followed different formats, most of them
                            specializing in only one format, and thereby fragmenting the e-book market even more. Due to
                            exclusiveness and limited readerships of e-books, the fractured market of independent
                            publishers and specialty authors lacked consensus regarding a standard for packaging and
                            selling e-books.</p>
                        <p>However, in the late 1990s a consortium formed to develop the Open eBook format as a way for
                            authors and publishers to provide a single source-document which many book-reading software
                            and hardware platforms could handle. Open eBook defined required subsets of XHTML and CSS; a
                            set of multimedia formats (others could be used, but there must also be a fallback in one of
                            the required formats); and an XML schema for a "manifest", to list the components of a given
                            eBooks, identify a table of contents, cover art, and so on. </p>
                        <h2>Benefits of E-Books</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1. Ebooks promote reading. People are spending more time in front of screens and less
                                time in front of printed books. </li>
                            <li> 2. Ebooks are good for the environment. Ebooks save trees. Ebooks eliminate the need
                                for filling up landfills with old books. Ebooks save transportation costs and the
                                pollution associated with shipping books across the country and the world. </li>
                            <li> 3. Ebooks preserve books. (As in history a lot of incident we can see that a library
                                get burned and a big collection of the books destryed, A person destryed the original
                                manuscript or his rival) Ebooks are ageless: they do not burn, mildew, crumble, rot, or
                                fall apart. Ebooks ensure that literature will endure. </li>
                            <li> 4. Ebooks, faster to produce than paper books, allow readers to read books about
                                current issues and events. </li>
                            <li> 5. Ebooks are easily updateable, for correcting errors and adding information. </li>
                            <li> 6. Ebooks are searchable. Quickly you can find anything inside the book. Ebooks are
                                globally searchable: you can find information in many ebooks. </li>
                            <li> 7. Ebooks are portable. You can carry an entire library on one DVD. </li>
                            <li> 8. Ebooks (in the form of digital audio books) free you to do other activities while
                                you are listening. </li>
                            <li> 9. Ebooks can be printable: and thereby give a reader most or all of the advantages of
                                a paper-based book. </li>
                            <li> 10. Ebooks defy time: they can be delivered almost instantly. Ebooks are transported to
                                you faster than overnight shipping: in minutes or in seconds. </li>
                            <li> 11. Ebooks defy space: ebooks online can be read simultaneously by thousands of people
                                at once. </li>
                            <li> 12. Ebooks are cheaper to produce. Thus, small presses can attempt to compete with
                                media giants. </li>
                            <li> 13. Ebooks are cheaper to buy. </li>
                            <li> 14. Ebooks are free. The magnificent work of Project Gutenberg, and other online public
                                libraries, allow readers to read the classics at no cost. </li>
                            <li> 15. Ebooks can be annotated without harming the original work.</li>
                            <li> 16. Ebooks make reading accessible to persons with disabilities. Text can be re-sized
                                for the visually impaired. Screens can be lit for reading in the dark. </li>
                            <li> 17. Ebooks can be hyper-linked, for easier access to additional information.</li>

                            <li> 19. Ebooks let you tweak the style. Many ebooks allow readers to change the font style,
                                font size, page size, margin size, colors, and more.</li>
                            <li> 20. Ebooks may allow the option for the addition of multimedia: still images, moving
                                images, and sound.</li>
                            <li> 21. Ebooks, with their capacity for storage, encourage the publishing of books with
                                many pages, books that might be too expensive to produce (and purchase) in paperback.
                            </li>
                            <li> 22. Ebooks can be quickly duplicated, and then distributed to strangers or given to
                                your friends. Worry no more about your loaned books that will never be returned.</li>
